# HelloWorld
My intro repository.

I am new to the world of programming and development and yet to truely find my niche.
Currently, I want to learn about web-development as it is not so resource heavy (I can use my old tech). I also want to learn networking, make a game or two and learn alot about infosec as a dream of mine is to be involved in live CTF games; but I am a long way from that.

I have started learning HTML and Ruby through SoloLearn, and scratch on my Raspberry Pi 2.

I look forward to learning and becoming involved in this amazing world.

Regards,
Alex
